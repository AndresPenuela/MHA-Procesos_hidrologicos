    "Jupyter Notebooks is a friendly and accessible programming interface. It basically consists of a document (similar to a Word document) in which we can integrate text, images, graphics and the Python code, which we can execute. Notebooks can be easily shared with other people, for example with our teacher, supervisor or collaborator to explain what we have done and so they can check that the whole process is correct.\n",

The cell below in gray color is a Code type cell where we can write Python code, execute it and see the results. Try executing the code below by clicking on the cell and then pressing the `SHIFT+Enter` keys (first press Shift and without releasing it press Enter).\n",
